# Bird-Migration
Notebook analysing the migration of purple martins.

# Project Overview
- Analysed the locations of 11 different purple martins sampled at frequent intevals of the year
- Separated the starting locations of the birds from their destinations
- Mapped each individual bird's flight path using GeoPandas and Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
- Found that all of the birds migrated to Brazil in the general area of the amazon rainforest
